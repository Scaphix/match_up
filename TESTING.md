## Code Validation


### HTML


I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Lighthouse Audit


I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.

## User Story Testing

All user stories from the project have been manually tested to ensure they meet the acceptance criteria. Below are the test results for each user story.

| Target | Expectation | Outcome | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| As a guest user | I would like to view the home page | so that I can understand what the platform offers. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/home.png) |
| As a new user | I can create an account/login to my account | so that I can access the dating platform. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/register.png) / ![screenshot](documentation/features/login.png) |
| As a registered user | I can create/edit my profile | so that other users can learn about me. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/create-profile.png) / ![screenshot](documentation/features/edit-profile.png) |
| As a registered user | I can delete my profile and account | so that I can remove my presence from the platform. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/delete-profile.png) |
| As a registered user | I can view other profiles | so that I can discover potential matches. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/discover.png) |
| As a registered user | I can rate a person (like or pass) | so that this person can be my match or not. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/like-profile.png) / ![screenshot](documentation/features/pass-profile.png) |
| As a registered user | I can see my mutual matches | so that I can connect with people who also like me. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/matches.png) |
| As a registered user | I want to be notified and automatically redirected to the matches page when I have a new match | so that I don't miss opportunities to connect. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/match-notification.png) |
| As a registered user | I can see profiles fade out after I like or pass on them | so that I get visual feedback that my action was successful. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/pass-profile.png) |
| As a registered user | I can view detailed profile information | so that I can learn more about someone before connecting. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/profile-detail.png) |
| As a registered user | I can return to the previous page when viewing a profile detail | so that I can easily continue browsing from where I left off. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/profile-detail.png) |
| As a registered user | I can see profiles I've liked | so that I can review my interests and revisit profiles. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/liked-profiles.png) |
| As a user | I would like responsive design on mobile | so that I can browse matches on any device. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/discover1.png) |
| As a user | I would like to see a 404 error page if I get lost | so that it's obvious that I've stumbled upon a page that doesn't exist. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/404.png) |

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

> [!NOTE]  
> I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### JavaScript (Jest Testing)


I have used the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) JavaScript testing framework to test the application functionality. In order to work with Jest, I first had to initialize NPM.

- `npm init`
- Hit `<enter>` for all options, except for **test command:**, just type `jest`.

Add Jest to a list called **Dev Dependencies** in a dev environment:

- `npm install --save-dev jest`

**IMPORTANT**: Initial configurations

When creating test files, the name of the file needs to be `file-name.test.js` in order for Jest to properly work. Without the following, Jest won't properly run the tests:

- `npm install -D jest-environment-jsdom`

Due to a change in Jest's default configuration, you'll need to add the following code to the top of the `.test.js` file:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

/* jshint esversion: 11, jquery: true */
/* global jest, require, describe, beforeEach, afterEach, test, expect, global */

const { test, expect } = require("@jest/globals");
const { function1, function2, function3, etc. } = require("../script-name");

beforeAll(() => {
    let fs = require("fs");
    let fileContents = fs.readFileSync("index.html", "utf-8");
    document.open();
    document.write(fileContents);
    document.close();
});
```

Remember to adjust the `fs.readFileSync()` to the specific file you'd like you test. The example above is testing the `index.html` file.

Finally, at the bottom of the script file where your primary scripts are written, include the following at the very bottom of the file. Make sure to include the name of all of your functions that are being tested in the `.test.js` file.

```js
/* jshint esversion: 11, jquery: true */
/* global module */
if (typeof module !== "undefined") module.exports = {
    function1, function2, function3, etc
};
```

Now that these steps have been undertaken, further tests can be written, and be expected to fail initially. Write JS code that can get the tests to pass as part of the Red-Green refactor process. Once ready, to run the tests, use this command:

- `npm test`

**NOTE**: To obtain a coverage report, use the following command:

- `npm test --coverage`

Below are the results from the tests that I've written for this application:

| Test Suites | Tests | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 passed | 16 passed | ![screenshot](documentation/automation/jest-coverage.png) |

#### Jest Test Issues



### Python (Unit Testing)


I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.
 
I created unit tests for the "dating" and "connections" app views which cover the applications main functionalities. All tests passed successfully.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

- `python3 manage.py test dating`
- `python3 manage.py test connections`

**Results:**

NO ERROR found:

![Test Results Screenshot](documentation/dating-test.png)


![Test Results Screenshot](documentation/connections-test.png)


To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

- `pip3 install coverage`
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- `coverage run --omit="*/site-packages/*,*/migrations/*,*/__init__.py,env.py,.env" manage.py test`
- `coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

- `coverage html`
- `python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the full coverage report on my application that I've tested:
